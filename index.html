    <div class="container">
      <p>Food is one of the few topics that affects every single person in the UK; we all have, or should have, a vested interest in what we eat, where our food comes from, the safety of our food and the future sustainability of our food system. The UK Food Industry represents the countryâ€™s biggest manufacturing sector, and contributes Â£28.2 billion to the economy.</p>
      <p>However, like every other industry in the UK, the food sector is facing a period of unprecedented uncertainty as we move closer to leaving the EU. How the UKâ€™s exit from the EU will affect the UK Food Industry is perhaps one of the most important questions we must ask of Brexit.</p>
      <p>UKGovHack 2017 aims to tackle some of this uncertainty as we ask, â€˜What is the future of food in the face of Brexit?â€™ Throughout the event we will explore concerns of manufacturers, SMEs, import and exporters, farmers, government agencies and citizens. We will use open data to understand what Brexit means for issues including food sustainability, traceability, and crisis management; what trade and free movement of goods will look like and how farming will change without the common agricultural policy.</p>
